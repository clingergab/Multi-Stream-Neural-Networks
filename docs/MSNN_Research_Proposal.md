# Multi-Stream Neural Networks for RGB-D Scene Classification

**Research Proposal**

---

## Abstract

I propose Multi-Stream Neural Networks (MSNNs), a novel architecture inspired by biological visual processing that employs multiple weight connections between neurons to separately process distinct visual features. Unlike traditional neural networks that use single weights to aggregate all information between neurons, MSNNs use specialized weight channels that develop domain-specific expertise while enabling efficient cross-modal learning within a unified model.

As AI training capabilities outpace data generation, this architecture addresses the critical challenge of extracting richer information from existing datasets. I will validate MSNNs on RGB-D scene classification using the NYU Depth V2 dataset, demonstrating that separate processing pathways can achieve competitive accuracy (66-69%) with ResNet18-scale models while providing 1.5-2x training speedup and 25-50% memory savings compared to traditional ensemble methods.

## 1. Motivation and Problem Statement

### 1.1 Addressing the Data Plateau Challenge

The AI field is approaching a critical inflection point where model training capabilities are outpacing data generation. Multi-Stream Neural Networks offer a timely solution to this challenge:

**Richer Data Utilization**: By explicitly separating and processing different modalities (RGB and depth), I extract more value from existing datasets without requiring new data collection. Each pathway develops specialized expertise in its domain, enabling the network to learn richer representations than traditional single-stream approaches.

**Multi-Modal Scalability**: The architecture naturally extends to incorporate additional data streams (NIR, thermal, radar) as they become available, future-proofing against data scarcity. The same architectural principles apply regardless of the number or type of modalities.

**Efficiency at Scale**: With major labs training models faster than new datasets can be curated, this approach maximizes learning from available data through specialized processing pathways that share computation within a single unified model.

### 1.2 Core Architecture Advantages

Multi-Stream Neural Networks achieve the benefits of multi-modal learning and ensemble methods while maintaining single-model efficiency:

**Training Efficiency**
- **1.5-2x training speedup** through unified execution compared to training multiple separate models
- **25-50% memory savings** from shared optimizer states and gradient storage
- More efficient gradient computation by avoiding redundant calculations

**Computational Benefits**
- Comparable inference performance to traditional models with no significant runtime overhead
- Parameter efficiency - achieving ensemble-like performance without proportional parameter increases
- Improved hardware utilization through better memory access patterns and reduced context switching

**Learning Advantages**
- Native cross-modal learning - features from different streams inform each other during training
- Enhanced robustness to domain-specific variations (e.g., lighting changes, sensor noise)
- Flexible feature integration through learnable mechanisms that discover optimal combination strategies

### 1.3 Biological Inspiration

The human visual system provides a compelling model for specialized processing:

- **Parvocellular pathway**: Processes color and fine spatial detail
- **Magnocellular pathway**: Processes brightness, motion, and depth
- These pathways maintain separation while integrating at higher cortical levels

Traditional artificial neural networks use single weights between neurons, forcing all information through the same connection. This differs from biological neural networks where multiple synaptic connections between the same neurons allow parallel processing of different information types. MSNNs bridge this gap by introducing multiple specialized weight channels between neurons.

### 1.4 Research Questions

1. Can separate processing pathways for RGB and depth achieve competitive performance with significantly better training efficiency than ensemble methods?
2. Which integration strategies (basic concatenation, learned linear mixing, learnable scalar weights) provide the best balance of accuracy and interpretability?
3. Does the multi-stream architecture provide improved robustness to modality-specific perturbations compared to traditional fusion approaches?
4. How do integration weights evolve during training, and what do they reveal about the relative importance of different modalities?

## 2. Related Work

**Multi-Modal Fusion Approaches**: Current RGB-D methods use early fusion (concatenate inputs), late fusion (separate models), or intermediate fusion (ad-hoc combinations). Published benchmarks on NYU Depth V2 include Song et al. (66.4%, VGG16), Wang et al. (68.7%, ResNet), and Hu et al. (69.5%, ResNet50).

**Gap**: No existing work maintains dedicated modality-specific processing pathways within a single model while enabling continuous cross-modal learning. Multi-task learning shares backbones but all features flow through the same pathway. MSNNs introduce parallel pathways with learnable integration throughout network depth.

## 3. Proposed Architecture

### 3.1 Core Concept

Multi-Stream Neural Networks introduce multiple parallel weight connections between layers, with each weight specializing in different data modalities:

```
Input: RGB (3 channels) + Depth (1 channel)
         ↓                    ↓
    [RGB Stream]         [Depth Stream]
         ↓                    ↓
    RGB Weights          Depth Weights
         ↓                    ↓
    RGB Features         Depth Features
         ↘                  ↙
           Integration
                 ↓
              Output
```

**Key Innovation**: Rather than forcing all information through single-weight connections, each neuron maintains separate weights for different modalities. This enables:
- Modality-specific feature learning
- Learnable integration strategies
- Efficient cross-modal information flow

### 3.2 Implementation Approaches

I will evaluate four integration strategies, progressing from simplest to most sophisticated:

#### Approach 1: Basic Multi-Channel (Baseline)

Separate pathways remain independent until final classification:

```python
rgb_l = ReLU(W_rgb^l · rgb_{l-1} + b_rgb^l)
depth_l = ReLU(W_d^l · depth_{l-1} + b_d^l)
output = Classifier([rgb_L; depth_L])  # Concatenate at end
```

**Properties**:
- Complete pathway independence throughout network
- No cross-modal learning during feature extraction
- Baseline for measuring integration benefits
- Parameters: ~23.4M for ResNet18

**Efficiency vs Separate Models**: Nearly identical parameter count to training two separate ResNet18 models, but provides 1.5-2x training speedup from unified execution, 42% memory savings (shared optimizer state), and 50% gradient storage reduction.

#### Approach 2: Concat + Linear Integration

Integration at each layer through learned linear transformations:

```python
rgb_l = ReLU(W_rgb^l · rgb_{l-1} + b_rgb^l)
depth_l = ReLU(W_d^l · depth_{l-1} + b_d^l)
concat_l = [rgb_l; depth_l; integrated_{l-1}]
integrated_l = ReLU(W_i^l · concat_l + b_i^l)
```

**Properties**:
- Enables cross-modal learning throughout network depth
- Integration layer learns arbitrary non-linear combinations
- Parameters: O(3h²) per integration layer
- Standard gradient flow (similar to ResNet, DenseNet)

**Advantage**: Features from both modalities inform each other at every layer, but lower interpretability as importance is distributed across weight matrices.

#### Approach 3: Direct Mixing with Learnable Weights

Uses learnable scalar parameters (α, β, γ) to control pathway mixing:

```python
rgb_l = ReLU(W_rgb^l · rgb_{l-1} + b_rgb^l)
depth_l = ReLU(W_d^l · depth_{l-1} + b_d^l)
integrated_l = α_l · rgb_l + β_l · depth_l + γ_l · integrated_{l-1}
```

Where α, β, γ are learnable parameters initialized to 1.0, 1.0, 0.2 respectively.

**Properties**:
- Only 3 scalar parameters per layer
- High interpretability - α, β, γ directly show pathway importance
- Gradients scaled by integration weights
- Self-organizing - network learns optimal mixing ratios

**Key Advantages**:
- Can analyze which modality dominates at each layer
- Minimal parameter overhead
- Prevents pathway collapse through gradient clipping and regularization
- Direct insight into network's integration strategy

### 3.3 Design Decisions and Rationale

**Why ResNet18 Backbone?** Fair comparison with published work, demonstrates efficiency at moderate scale (23M parameters).

**Integration Weight Initialization**: α=β=1.0 for equal initial pathway contribution, γ=0.2 to prevent gradient explosion.

**Key Implementation**: Approaches 1-3 form the core experimental framework, comparing independent pathways (Approach 1) against two integration strategies (Approaches 2-3).

## 4. Experimental Validation

### 4.1 Dataset: NYU Depth V2

**Why RGB+Depth Instead of RGB+Luminance?**

A critical architectural decision: while RGB+Luminance would be simpler to implement (L = 0.2126×R + 0.7152×G + 0.0722×B), it suffers from a fundamental flaw - **luminance is merely a linear combination of RGB**, creating deterministic dependency between streams. This leads to:
- **Redundant learning**: The brightness stream has zero independent information
- **Limited biological plausibility**: Real biological systems use physically separate sensors (rods vs cones), not derived features
- **Pathway collapse risk**: Networks can trivially learn the linear relationship, making separate pathways redundant

RGB+Depth from NYU Depth V2 provides **genuinely independent modalities** from physically separate sensors (RGB camera + Kinect depth sensor), avoiding this correlation problem entirely.

**Dataset Details**:
- **Size**: 1,449 RGB-D images (795 train / 654 test)
- **Task**: 40-class indoor scene classification  
- **Modalities**: RGB (color/texture) + Depth (geometric/spatial structure)
- **Existing Benchmarks**: Multiple published results enable direct comparison

### 4.2 Baselines and Target Performance

**Baselines**: RGB-only (~55-58%), Depth-only (~45-50%), Early Fusion 4-channel input (~60-63%), Late Fusion two separate models (~62-65%, 2x training time).

**Target**: 66-69% accuracy with ResNet18 (23.4M parameters), competitive with Wang et al. (68.7%) and Hu et al. (69.5%, ResNet50), while achieving 1.5-2x training speedup and 25-50% memory savings vs Late Fusion.

### 4.3 Evaluation Metrics

**Primary**: Classification accuracy, training time, memory usage.

**Secondary**: Robustness under modality corruption, integration weight evolution (which modality dominates at each layer), cross-dataset transfer (SUN RGB-D).

## 5. Expected Contributions

This research explores whether dedicated modality-specific pathways within a single neural network can achieve competitive performance with better training efficiency than ensemble methods. The architecture may provide:

- **Training efficiency**: Potential for 1.5-2x faster training and 25-50% memory savings compared to separate model ensembles
- **Interpretability**: Learnable integration weights (α, β, γ) that reveal modality importance at different network depths
- **Extensibility**: Framework naturally extends to additional modalities (thermal, NIR, radar) without architectural redesign
- **Data utilization**: Richer feature learning from multi-modal datasets through specialized processing pathways

The approach validates biological processing principles computationally and may offer insights for deploying multi-modal models in resource-constrained environments.

## 6. Technical Challenges

**Pathway Collapse**: One pathway may dominate while others atrophy. Mitigation: gradient monitoring, pathway-specific clipping, regularization on integration weights.

**Training Instability**: Different modality characteristics may cause vanishing/exploding gradients. Mitigation: careful initialization (α=β=1.0, γ=0.2), batch normalization within pathways.

**Limited Dataset Size**: NYU Depth V2 has only 1,449 images. Mitigation: strong data augmentation, early stopping, validation on SUN RGB-D.

## 7. Conclusion

Multi-Stream Neural Networks address a critical challenge at the intersection of data efficiency and computational practicality. As AI training capabilities outpace data generation, architectures that extract richer information from existing multi-modal datasets become increasingly valuable.

This research will demonstrate that biologically-inspired parallel processing pathways can achieve:

1. **Competitive accuracy** with state-of-the-art methods using smaller models
2. **Significant training efficiency** gains (1.5-2x speedup, 25-50% memory savings) over ensemble methods
3. **Interpretable integration** strategies that reveal task-specific modality importance
4. **Practical deployment** advantages through single-model architecture

By validating MSNNs on RGB-D scene classification with established benchmarks (NYU Depth V2), I will provide a principled framework for multi-modal learning that scales naturally to emerging sensor modalities and resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

The core insight - that neural networks can benefit from dedicated processing pathways with learnable integration, just as biological systems do - has potential to reshape how we approach multi-modal learning in computer vision and beyond.
