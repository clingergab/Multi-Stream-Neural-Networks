## 🔥 Major Features Implemented

### Unified Progress Bar
```
Epoch 1/10: 100%|███| 13/13 [00:01<00:00, T_loss=1.82, T_acc=0.25, V_loss=1.54, V_acc=0.30]
```
**Previously:** Separate progress bars for training and validation  
**Now:** Single unified bar with all metrics

### Automatic GPU Optimization
```python
# Automatic device detection and optimization
device_manager = DeviceManager()
model = BaseMultiChannelNetwork(device_manager=device_manager)
model.fit(train_loader, val_loader, epochs=10)  # Fully optimized automatically
```

### Keras-like API
```python
# Simple, familiar interface
model.compile(optimizer='adam', lr=0.001)
model.fit(train_data, validation_data, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
metrics = model.evaluate(test_data)
```
