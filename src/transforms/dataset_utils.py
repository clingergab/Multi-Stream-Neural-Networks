    Convert RGB dataset to RGB + Brightness streams efficiently.
    
    This function processes a PyTorch dataset in batches to manage memory usage,
    applying the RGB to RGB+L transform to create separate color and brightness streams.

        reducing memory requirements.
        
    TODO:
        For future development, consider replacing all usages of this function with
        the more memory-efficient `create_dataloader_with_streams` approach for better
        scalability with large datasets.
