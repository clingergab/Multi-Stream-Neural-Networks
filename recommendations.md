## Fundamental Learning Issues in MultiChannelResNetNetwork

Based on our investigation, the following are potential issues that could be preventing the 
MultiChannelResNetNetwork from learning properly (having poor training accuracy):

### 1. Gradient Flow Problems

- **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**: Custom multi-channel layers might not be propagating 
  gradients correctly through the network.
  
- **Recursive Gradient Clipping**: The model uses a recursive gradient clipping approach that
  might be causing issues with gradient computation.
  
- **Broken Backpropagation**: There might be operations breaking the computational graph,
  such as accidental detachment of tensors.

### 2. Layer Implementation Issues

- **MultiChannelConv2d**: Separate weights for color and brightness might not be initialized 
  or updated properly. The current initialization uses `fan_in` mode, but `fan_out` might be
  better for ResNet-style architectures.
  
- **MultiChannelBatchNorm2d**: BatchNorm momentum settings or initialization might not be 
  optimal for the dual-pathway architecture.
  
- **MultiChannelResNetBasicBlock**: The residual connections might not be functioning properly,
  which is critical for ResNet architecture.

### 3. Architecture and Data Flow Issues

- **Complexity vs Dataset Size**: The ResNet architecture might be too complex for CIFAR-100
  without proper adaptation. While `reduce_architecture=True` helps, there might still be
  issues with the network depth and width.
  
- **Downsampling Strategy**: The initial layers might be too aggressive in downsampling for
  CIFAR-100's small images (32x32).
  
- **Parameter Sharing**: The separate pathways for color and brightness might lead to 
  inefficient learning if one pathway dominates.

### 4. Training Process Issues

- **Learning Rate**: The learning rate might not be appropriate for the model's architecture,
  especially considering the dual pathway nature.
  
- **Weight Decay**: Inappropriate weight decay settings could prevent the model from learning.

- **Mixed Precision**: Issues with mixed precision training could lead to unstable updates.

## Immediate Diagnostic Steps

1. **Run the diagnostics script** to analyze gradient flow, parameter magnitudes, and activation patterns

2. **Monitor weight updates** during training to ensure parameters are actually changing

3. **Check for dead neurons** in each pathway to see if certain parts of the network are not learning

4. **Compare with BaseMultiChannelNetwork** to identify differences in architecture and behavior

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Simplify the architecture**:
   ```python
   # For CIFAR-100, consider a much simpler architecture
   model = MultiChannelResNetNetwork(
       num_classes=100,
       num_blocks=[1, 1, 1, 1],  # Simplify to just one block per stage
       reduce_architecture=True,  # Already implemented
       dropout=0.2  # Add more regularization
   )
   ```

2. **Fix gradient clipping**:
   ```python
   # Use a manual, non-recursive approach to gradient clipping
   total_norm = 0
   for p in parameters:
       if p.grad is not None:
           param_norm = p.grad.data.norm(2)
           total_norm += param_norm.item() ** 2
   total_norm = total_norm ** 0.5
   
   clip_coef = max_norm / (total_norm + 1e-6)
   if clip_coef < 1.0:
       for p in parameters:
           if p.grad is not None:
               p.grad.data.mul_(clip_coef)
   ```

3. **Optimize BatchNorm settings**:
   ```python
   # Adjust BatchNorm momentum for more stable updates
   for module in self.modules():
       if isinstance(module, MultiChannelBatchNorm2d):
           module.color_bn.momentum = 0.1  # PyTorch default
           module.brightness_bn.momentum = 0.1
   ```

4. **Weight initialization**:
   ```python
   # Improve weight initialization for ResNet architecture
   for module in self.modules():
       if isinstance(module, MultiChannelConv2d):
           nn.init.kaiming_normal_(module.color_weight, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='relu')
           nn.init.kaiming_normal_(module.brightness_weight, mode='fan_out', nonlinearity='relu')
   ```

5. **Learning rate scheduling**:
   ```python
   # Use OneCycleLR for better convergence
   scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.OneCycleLR(
       optimizer,
       max_lr=learning_rate,
       total_steps=steps_per_epoch * epochs,
       pct_start=0.3,
       div_factor=25,
       final_div_factor=1000,
       anneal_strategy='cos'
   )
   ```

## Implementation Priority

1. First, run diagnostics to identify the most critical issues
2. Fix BatchNorm and weight initialization issues
3. Implement proper gradient clipping
4. Simplify the architecture
5. Optimize learning rate and scheduling

After implementing these changes, the model should show improved learning on both training and 
validation sets for CIFAR-100.
