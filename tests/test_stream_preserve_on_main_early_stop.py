"""
Test that frozen stream weights are preserved when main early stopping triggers.

Scenario:
1. Stream1 freezes at epoch X â†’ Stream1 weights restored to best
2. Training continues with Stream2 + integration
3. Main early stopping triggers â†’ Full model restored BUT Stream1 weights should be preserved

This ensures that frozen streams keep their best weights even after main model restoration.
