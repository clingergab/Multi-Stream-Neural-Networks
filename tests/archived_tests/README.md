# Archived Test Files

These test files were created during the refactoring and standardization of the Multi-Stream Neural Networks API.

## Files

- `test_all_methods.py`: Comprehensive test of all methods (fit, evaluate, predict, predict_proba) for both BaseMultiChannelNetwork and MultiChannelResNetNetwork.
- `test_predict_methods.py`: Initial test for predict() and predict_proba() methods.
- `test_api_consistency_fix.py`: Test for API consistency across model types.
- `test_base_class_consolidation.py`: Test for base class method consolidation.
- `test_unified_validate.py`: Test for unified validation method implementation.

These tests have been replaced by the more structured test implementation in `test_api_methods.py`.
