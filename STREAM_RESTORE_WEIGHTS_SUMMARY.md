# Stream-Specific Restore Best Weights Implementation

## Overview

Implemented automatic stream-specific weight restoration for multi-stream neural networks when using stream early stopping. When a stream freezes due to plateauing performance, the stream's best weights are automatically restored before freezing. **When all streams freeze (triggering training stop), the full model's best weights are also restored**, ensuring optimal final model state.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

#### 1. `src/models/common/model_helpers.py`

**`setup_stream_early_stopping()` function:**
- **Removed** optional `stream_restore_best_weights` parameter
- Weight restoration is now **always enabled** when `stream_early_stopping=True`
- Added `best_weights` field to both `stream1` and `stream2` state dictionaries
- Added `best_full_model` tracking for overall model performance
- Updated docstring to reflect automatic restoration behavior
- Updated verbose output to show full model restoration when all streams freeze

**`check_stream_early_stopping()` function:**
- **Always saves** stream-specific weights when stream accuracy improves (no longer conditional)
- **Always restores** stream weights before freezing (no longer conditional)
- **Tracks best full model state** throughout training (validation accuracy + full state_dict)
- **Restores full model weights** when all streams freeze (training stop condition)
- Saves only parameters matching `.stream1_` or `.stream2_` patterns for streams
- Saves complete state_dict for full model restoration
- Restores weights to correct device using `.to(param.device)`
- Prints restoration messages for both streams and full model
- Freezes stream parameters after restoration

**MCResNet and LINet `fit()` methods:**
- Updated to pass `val_acc` to `check_stream_early_stopping()`
- Enables full model accuracy tracking for best weight selection

### How It Works

1. **During Training:**
   - Each epoch, track full model validation accuracy
   - If full model val_acc improves: save complete model state_dict
   - If a stream's validation accuracy improves by more than `min_delta`:
     - Save all stream-specific parameters (`.stream1_*` or `.stream2_*`) to CPU
     - Reset patience counter for that stream

2. **When Stream Plateaus:**
   - When patience counter reaches threshold:
     - Restore best weights from saved state (move to correct device)
     - Print restoration message
     - Freeze stream parameters (`.stream1_*` or `.stream2_*`)
     - Integration/fusion weights remain trainable

3. **When All Streams Freeze:**
   - Detect that both Stream1 and Stream2 are frozen
   - Restore full model's best weights (complete state_dict from best epoch)
   - Print restoration message showing epoch and validation accuracy
   - Training stops with optimal model state

4. **Parameter Selection:**
   - **Stream1 parameters**: All parameters with `.stream1_` in the name
   - **Stream2 parameters**: All parameters with `.stream2_` in the name
   - **Full model**: Complete state_dict (all parameters including streams, integration, fusion, classifier)
   - **NOT saved separately**: Integration weights, fusion weights (included in full model)

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_stream_restore_weights.py`:

### Tests Included

1. **`test_stream_weights_saved_on_improvement`**
   - Verifies that weights are saved when stream accuracy improves

2. **`test_stream_weights_restored_before_freezing`**
   - Confirms restoration messages appear when streams freeze
   - Verifies full model restoration message when all streams freeze
   - Tests with verbose output to capture all restoration logs
   - Verifies at least one stream freezes with low patience

3. **`test_correct_stream_weights_are_saved`**
   - Validates correct parameter identification
   - Ensures stream1 and stream2 parameters don't overlap
   - Found 60 stream1 parameters and 60 stream2 parameters in ResNet18

4. **`test_weights_actually_different_after_restore`**
   - Confirms weights change during training
   - Prepares for verification that restored weights differ from current

5. **`test_integration_weights_not_saved`**
   - Verifies integration/fusion weights are NOT saved in stream-specific weights
   - Confirms only fc.weight and fc.bias are non-stream-specific in ResNet18

### Test Results

All 5 tests passed successfully:
```
tests/test_stream_restore_weights.py::test_stream_weights_saved_on_improvement PASSED [ 20%]
tests/test_stream_restore_weights.py::test_stream_weights_restored_before_freezing PASSED [ 40%]
tests/test_stream_restore_weights.py::test_correct_stream_weights_are_saved PASSED [ 60%]
tests/test_stream_restore_weights.py::test_weights_actually_different_after_restore PASSED [ 80%]
tests/test_stream_restore_weights.py::test_integration_weights_not_saved PASSED [100%]
```

Example output from restoration test:
```
‚úì Stream1 was frozen and weights were restored from epoch 4
‚úì Stream2 was frozen and weights were restored from epoch 5
‚úì Full model weights were restored when all streams froze

Final stream accuracies:
  Stream1: 0.1250
  Stream2: 0.1250
```

## Usage

No code changes required in training scripts! The feature is automatic:

```python
# Simply enable stream_early_stopping - restoration happens automatically
history = model.fit(
    train_loader=train_loader,
    val_loader=val_loader,
    epochs=50,
    stream_monitoring=True,
    stream_early_stopping=True,  # Enables automatic weight restoration
    stream1_patience=10,
    stream2_patience=10,
    stream_min_delta=0.001
)
```

Output during training:
```
‚ùÑÔ∏è  Stream-specific early stopping enabled:
   Stream1 patience: 10, Stream2 patience: 10
   Min delta: 0.001
   Restore best weights: Enabled (streams + full model when all frozen)

[... training epochs ...]

üîÑ Restored Stream1 best weights from epoch 15
‚ùÑÔ∏è  Stream1 frozen (no improvement for 10 epochs, best: 0.8245 at epoch 15)

[... more training epochs ...]

üîÑ Restored Stream2 best weights from epoch 22
‚ùÑÔ∏è  Stream2 frozen (no improvement for 10 epochs, best: 0.7890 at epoch 22)
üîÑ Restored full model best weights from epoch 20 (val_acc: 0.8512)
üõë All streams frozen - stopping training
```

## Benefits

1. **Automatic**: No need to manually specify `stream_restore_best_weights`
2. **Optimal**: Streams always use their best performing weights when frozen
3. **Full Model Restoration**: Complete model restored to best state when training stops
4. **Preserves Frozen Streams**: When main early stopping triggers, frozen stream weights are preserved (not overwritten)
5. **Prevents Degradation**: Avoids freezing streams with suboptimal weights
6. **Consistent**: Same behavior across MCResNet and LINet models
7. **Device Agnostic**: Works correctly on CPU, CUDA, and MPS devices

## Technical Notes

### Weight Storage
- Weights saved to CPU to avoid device memory issues
- Restored to correct device automatically using `.to(param.device)`
- Only stream-specific parameters saved (not integration/fusion weights)

### Parameter Matching
Stream parameters identified by naming convention:
- Stream1: `'.stream1_' in param_name`
- Stream2: `'.stream2_' in param_name`

Examples:
- Stream1: `layer1.0.conv1.stream1_weight`, `bn1.stream1_bias`
- Stream2: `layer2.1.conv2.stream2_weight`, `bn2.stream2_bias`
- NOT saved: `fc.weight`, `fc.bias`, `fusion.weight`

### Freezing Behavior
When a stream freezes:
1. Best weights restored
2. Stream parameters set to `requires_grad=False`
3. Integration/fusion weights remain trainable (`requires_grad=True`)
4. Model continues training with other stream + integration

### Weight Restoration Logic - Three Scenarios

The restoration behavior depends on which early stopping mechanism triggers:

#### Scenario 1: Main Early Stopping (No Streams Frozen)
```
Epoch 1-10: All streams training together
Epoch 8: Best full model performance (85% val_acc)
Epoch 10: Main early stopping triggers
```

**What happens:**
- Restore **complete model state** from epoch 8
- All streams (Stream1, Stream2, integration, classifier) get weights from epoch 8
- Everything comes from the same epoch (consistency)

**Output:**
```
üîÑ Restored best model weights
```

#### Scenario 2: All Streams Freeze (Stream Early Stopping)
```
Epoch 5: Stream1 freezes ‚Üí Stream1 restored to best (epoch 3, 72%)
Epoch 6-9: Training continues with Stream2 + integration
Epoch 8: Best full model performance (85% val_acc)
Epoch 10: Stream2 freezes ‚Üí triggers full restoration
```

**What happens:**
- Stream1: **Keeps** frozen best weights from epoch 3 (preserved)
- Stream2: Gets weights from best full model epoch (epoch 8)
- Integration/Classifier: Gets weights from best full model epoch (epoch 8)
- First frozen stream is locked, second frozen stream + rest from best full model epoch

**Output:**
```
üîÑ Restored Stream2 best weights from epoch X
‚ùÑÔ∏è  Stream2 frozen (no improvement for Y epochs)
üîÑ Restored full model best weights from epoch 8 (val_acc: 0.8500, preserved Stream1)
```

#### Scenario 3: One Stream Frozen + Main Early Stopping
```
Epoch 5: Stream1 freezes ‚Üí Stream1 restored to best (epoch 3, 72%)
Epoch 6-14: Training continues with Stream2 + integration
Epoch 12: Best full model performance (88% val_acc)
Epoch 15: Main early stopping triggers
```

**What happens:**
- Stream1: **Keeps** frozen best weights from epoch 3 (preserved)
- Stream2: Gets weights from best full model epoch (epoch 12)
- Integration/Classifier: Gets weights from best full model epoch (epoch 12)
- Frozen streams stay locked, unfrozen components from best full model epoch

**Output:**
```
üîÑ Restored best model weights (preserved frozen Stream1)
```

### Key Principle: Unfrozen Components Move Together

**The golden rule:** All unfrozen components (streams, integration, classifier) are restored from the **same epoch** - the best full model epoch. This ensures consistency and prevents mismatched weights from different training phases.

Frozen streams are "locked in" at their best performance and never changed, regardless of what happens afterward.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add option to restore weights at end of training (not just when freezing)
2. Support for more than 2 streams (stream3, stream4, etc.)
3. Configurable parameter matching patterns
4. Weight delta analysis (how much did weights change before/after restoration)

## Compatibility

- **Models**: MCResNet, LINet
- **Devices**: CPU, CUDA, MPS
- **PyTorch**: 2.0+
- **No breaking changes**: Existing training scripts continue to work
