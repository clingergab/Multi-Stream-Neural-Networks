## Configuration Summary

### Synchronized Augmentations (Both Streams)

```python
Horizontal Flip:        50% probability
Random Resized Crop:    50% probability
  └─ Scale:             0.9 - 1.0 (gentle crop, preserves 90-100% of image)
  └─ Aspect Ratio:      0.95 - 1.05 (minimal distortion)
```

**Key Decision**: Crop is **50% probabilistic** (not 100%) because:
- Scene classification needs full spatial context
- Bedroom = bed + nightstand + window together
- Kitchen = stove + counter + cabinets together
- Cropping removes critical spatial relationships
- 50% of samples preserve full scene, 50% get scale variance

### RGB-Only Augmentations

```python
Color Jitter:           50% probability
  └─ Brightness:        ±20%
  └─ Contrast:          ±20%
  └─ Saturation:        ±20%
  └─ Hue:               ±5%

Grayscale:              5% probability (rare)

Random Erasing:         10% probability
  └─ Patch Size:        2-10% of image
  └─ Aspect Ratio:      0.5 - 2.0
```

### Depth-Only Augmentations

```python
Combined Appearance:    50% probability (SINGLE BLOCK)
  └─ Brightness:        ±25%  (slightly higher than RGB)
  └─ Contrast:          ±25%  (slightly higher than RGB)
  └─ Gaussian Noise:    std=15 (5.9% of pixel range)

Random Erasing:         10% probability
  └─ Patch Size:        2-10% of image
  └─ Aspect Ratio:      0.5 - 2.0
```

**Why Depth has ±25% vs RGB's ±20%**:
1. Depth has 1 channel, RGB has 3 channels → need to compensate
2. Crop reduced from 100% to 50% → need more appearance variance
3. ±25% is still moderate (not excessive)
4. Achieves balance ratio of 1.25

## Balance Analysis

### Variance Metrics
```
RGB Mean Variance:      0.5883
Depth Mean Variance:    0.4725
Balance Ratio:          1.25  ✅ (target: 0.8-1.25)
```

### Augmentation Stacking Distribution
```
No crop, no appearance:         12.5%  (minimal augmentation)
Crop OR appearance (not both):  50.0%  (moderate augmentation)
Crop AND appearance:            25.0%  (strong augmentation)
All augmentations + erasing:     2.5%  (very strong augmentation)
```

**Assessment**:
- 62.5% of samples get ≤moderate augmentation (not too much)
- Only 2.5% get all augmentations (rare)
- Good distribution for balanced learning

## Design Rationale

### 1. Why 50% Crop (Not 100%)?

**Problem**: Object classification uses 100% crop, but we're doing **scene classification**

**Scene Classification Characteristics**:
- Requires full spatial context and layout
- Spatial relationships between objects are critical
- Example: A bedroom isn't just a bed - it's bed + nightstand + window + floor arrangement

**Literature Support**:
- ImageNet (objects): 100% crop @ 0.08-1.0 (very aggressive)
- Places365 (scenes): Minimal cropping, often just center crop
- SUN RGB-D papers: Typically resize without aggressive random crop

**Our Solution**: 50% crop @ 0.9-1.0
- 50% samples: Full scene context preserved (just resize)
- 50% samples: Gentle scale variance (90-100% crop)
- Best of both worlds: context + variance

### 2. Why Depth ±25% vs RGB ±20%?

**Problem**: RGB has 3 channels, Depth has 1 channel

**Analysis**:
- RGB color jitter affects R, G, B channels → 3× variance
- Depth appearance affects only 1 channel → 1× variance
- Even with same ±20%, RGB creates more total variance

**Solution**: Increase depth to ±25%
- Compensates for channel difference
- Compensates for reduced crop (50% vs 100%)
- Still moderate (not excessive)
- Achieves balanced ratio 1.25

### 3. Why Combined Appearance Block?

**Problem**: Originally depth had TWO separate augmentations (noise + brightness/contrast)
- Could stack together 25% of the time
- Created unequal augmentation opportunities vs RGB

**Solution**: SINGLE 50% block with brightness + contrast + noise combined
- Matches RGB's single 50% color jitter block
- No stacking issues
- Fair regularization for both streams

## Comparison with Standards

| Aspect | ImageNet (Objects) | Places365 (Scenes) | Our Approach | Assessment |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Crop Prob** | 100% | ~100% (center) | 50% | Scene-appropriate ✅ |
| **Crop Scale** | 0.08-1.0 | Minimal | 0.9-1.0 | Conservative ✅ |
| **Flip** | 50% | 50% | 50% | Standard ✅ |
| **Appearance** | Color jitter | Minimal | Color/Noise 50% | Balanced ✅ |
| **Erasing** | 10-15% | Rare | 10% | Standard ✅ |

**Conclusion**: Our approach is **more conservative** than ImageNet while being **task-appropriate** for scenes.

## Expected Training Impact

### Current Problem (Before Augmentation)
- Severe overfitting: 28% train/val gap (95.2% train vs 67.0% val)
- Weak stream performance: Stream1 49.5%, Stream2 49.9%
- Over-regularization from excessive weight decay

### Expected Results (With Balanced Augmentation)

**Overfitting Reduction**:
- Current gap: 28%
- Expected gap: 8-12%
- Mechanism: Augmentation provides regularization → can reduce weight decay

**Stream Performance**:
- Current: Stream1 49.5%, Stream2 49.9%
- Expected: Stream1 55-58%, Stream2 52-55%
- Mechanism: Balanced augmentation → both streams learn equally

**Validation Accuracy**:
- Current: 67.0%
- Expected: 70-73%
- Mechanism: Better generalization from data augmentation

### Key Code Sections

**Synchronized Crop (Lines 150-162)**:
```python
# 50% probability crop
if np.random.random() < 0.5:
    i, j, h, w = transforms.RandomResizedCrop.get_params(
        rgb, scale=(0.9, 1.0), ratio=(0.95, 1.05)
    )
    rgb = transforms.functional.resized_crop(rgb, i, j, h, w, self.target_size)
    depth = transforms.functional.resized_crop(depth, i, j, h, w, self.target_size)
else:
    # Preserve full scene context
    rgb = transforms.functional.resize(rgb, self.target_size)
    depth = transforms.functional.resize(depth, self.target_size)
```

**Depth Appearance (Lines 179-202)**:
```python
# Single 50% block (no double-stacking)
if np.random.random() < 0.5:
    depth_array = np.array(depth, dtype=np.float32)

    # ±25% (slightly higher than RGB's ±20%)
    brightness_factor = np.random.uniform(0.75, 1.25)
    contrast_factor = np.random.uniform(0.75, 1.25)

    depth_array = (depth_array - 127.5) * contrast_factor + 127.5
    depth_array = depth_array * brightness_factor

    # Moderate noise
    noise = np.random.normal(0, 15, depth_array.shape)
    depth_array = depth_array + noise

    depth_array = np.clip(depth_array, 0, 255)
    depth = Image.fromarray(depth_array.astype(np.uint8), mode='L')
